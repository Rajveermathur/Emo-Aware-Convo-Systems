“I feel empty, like nothing matters.”
Why semantic search fails:
It may retrieve philosophical content about nihilism or motivation.
Why emotion-aware retrieval wins:
The emotion is burnout + depressive numbness, not abstract philosophy. The best response pulls grounding, validation, and gentle reconnection strategies.

“I don’t want to be a burden.”
Why semantic search fails:
It may return advice about dependency or productivity.
Why emotion-aware retrieval wins:
This is rooted in shame, low self-worth, and fear of rejection. The right retrieval emphasizes reassurance, relational safety, and self-compassion.

“People wouldn’t notice if I disappeared for a while.”
Why semantic search fails:
It might interpret this literally (taking a break, going offline).
Why emotion-aware retrieval wins:
This is a loneliness / passive-worthlessness signal adjacent to depressive ideation. Emotion-aware systems recognize risk level and respond with care, connection, and grounding.

“I’ve been sleeping too much.”
Why semantic search fails:
Likely retrieves sleep hygiene tips or medical articles.
Why emotion-aware retrieval wins:
In context, sleep is an avoidance/escape coping mechanism tied to emotional exhaustion, not a biological sleep issue.

“I think I’ve lost my spark.”
Why semantic search fails:
It may return creativity hacks or motivational quotes.
Why emotion-aware retrieval wins:
The core emotion is grief for one’s former self + hopelessness, requiring validation and reframing, not productivity advice.
